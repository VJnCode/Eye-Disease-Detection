# 👁️ Eye Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-18) model to detect common retinal diseases from fundus images. It supports detection for the following categories:

- 🟢 Normal
- 🔴 Cataract
- 🟠 Diabetic Retinopathy
- 🔵 Glaucoma

The frontend is built using React and hosted on Vercel, while the backend model is served via FastAPI and Hugging Face Spaces.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This application assists in the early detection of retinal diseases using AI, which can be critical in preventing vision loss. Given an image of a retina, the model classifies it into one of the predefined disease categories.

### 👨‍⚕️ Target Users
- Ophthalmologists
- Healthcare screening assistants
- Medical students and researchers
